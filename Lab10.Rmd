library(papaja)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
# load data
all_data <- read.csv("open_data/stroop_stand.csv")
# Stand Stroop effect
(stand_stroop <- t.test(all_data$incongruent_stand,
       all_data$congruent_stand,
       paired = TRUE))
# Sit Stroop effect
(sit_stroop <- t.test(all_data$incongruent_sit,
       all_data$congruent_sit,
       paired = TRUE))
```
The authors stated that:

The Stroop effects in both the sitting condition, M = 118.9 ms, t(49) = 16.52, p < .01, d = 2.376, and the standing condition, M = 95.9 ms, t(49) = 14.327, p < .01, d = 2.034, were highly reliable...

Our reproduction of the analysis found:

The Stroop effects in both the sitting condition, `r papaja::apa_print(sit_stroop)$full_result`, and the standing condition, `r papaja::apa_print(stand_stroop)$full_result`, were highly reliable...

## Advanced

The major finding in the paper was that the size of the Stroop "shrunk" when people were standing compared to sitting. The above analyses did not address this question, they only showed that the Stroop effect (slower RTs for incongruent than congruent) appeared to be significant in both sitting and standing conditions. According to the means, it looked like the overall effect was larger when people were sitting (118.9) compared to standing (95.9).

Although the authors used a repeated measures ANOVA to provide statistical evidence that the Stroop effect was smaller in the stand than sit condition, they could have used a paired samples t-test, which boils down to a one-sample t-test on the relevant difference scores.

i.e. :

```{r}
stand_stroop_scores <- all_data$incongruent_stand-all_data$congruent_stand
sit_stroop_scores <- all_data$incongruent_sit-all_data$congruent_sit
stroop_differences <- sit_stroop_scores - stand_stroop_scores
(paired_results <- t.test(stand_stroop_scores,
                         sit_stroop_scores,
                         paired=TRUE))
(interaction_results <- t.test(stroop_differences))
```
The authors claimed:

...but the most significant finding again was the shrinkage of the effect when participants were standing, F(1, 49) = 8.964, p = .004, Î·p2 = .155. 

We found the same result using a one-sample t-test, `r apa_print(interaction_results)$full_result`.

Notice, we found the same mean difference (22.91), and that we found the same p-value (.004). Finally as we will learn later in the course, $t$ is related to $F$, specifically $t^2 = F$, and $2.9941^2 = 8.964$.
